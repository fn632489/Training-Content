Sample Learning and Development Materials

This folder houses samples of the content I created in the role of business analyst \ learning and development specialist. 
These are the types of services and content I can provide in making your organization run more efficiently.

In this folder you will find samples the following: 
- Adobe Captivate eLearning modules
- documentation such as job aids, user guides, and FAQ's
- presentations for ILT and VILT sessions

I hope you enjoy this material as much as I enjoyed developing it.
